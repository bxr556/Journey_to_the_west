《第七回：八卦炉中逃大圣 五行山下定心猿》
This chapter covers Wukong’s time in Laozi’s furnace, the birth of his Fiery Golden Eyes, his final rampage, and his defeat by the Buddha.

**Journey to the West — Chapter 7

The Great Sage Escapes the Eight-Trigram Furnace —
The Monkey Heart Is Finally Subdued Beneath the Five-Elements Mountain**

Thrown Into Laozi’s Furnace

After Sun Wukong was captured, Laozi had him carried into the Eight-Trigram Furnace, powered by the deadly Samadhi True Fire. The gods believed:

“This will finally destroy him.”

For 49 days, the flames burned continuously.
But Sun Wukong was no ordinary being:

He had eaten Peaches of Immortality

Drunk immortal wine

Swallowed the Golden Elixir

Mastered celestial arts

Possessed an incredibly strong body

Instead of killing him, the flames refined him.

The intense smoke and fire scorched his eyes, permanently changing them. When the furnace door opened, he exploded out, shouting:

“I’m alive—and stronger!”

His eyes now glowed bright gold, shining with fiery light.
These became his legendary:

Fiery Golden Eyes (火眼金睛)
— able to see through illusions, demons, transformations, and darkness.

But they also became irritated by smoke and mist, which explains his later sensitivity.

Wukong’s Rampage

Once free, Wukong immediately turned on Heaven. He seized his gold-banded staff and shouted:

“You tried to burn me alive? Now I’ll burn all of Heaven!”

He stormed through the heavenly palaces, knocking over towers, smashing gates, striking down guards, and scattering immortals. No one dared block his path.

The Four Heavenly Kings, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Thunder Generals, and even Erlang Shen tried to stop him again—but now Wukong was even stronger.

He laughed wildly:

“Come one by one or all at once—I’ll fight you all!”

He fought his way to the Southern Heaven Gate, driving the armies back.

The Jade Emperor Seeks the Highest Help

At this moment, Heaven was in crisis.
Guanyin advised:

“Only the Buddha of the Western Paradise can subdue him.”

The Jade Emperor agreed and sent an urgent petition to Tathagata Buddha.

The Buddha descended from the Western Heaven, surrounded by light, and spoke calmly:

“Bring the Monkey before me.”

Wukong strode forward boldly and said:

“Who are you? Another one trying to stop the Great Sage Equal to Heaven?”

The Buddha smiled:

“Monkey, you are strong, but not truly enlightened. Tell me—why rebel?”

Wukong declared proudly:

“I want the Jade Emperor’s throne. I should rule Heaven!”

The entire court gasped.
The Buddha replied:

“If you can escape from the palm of my hand, I will let you be the Jade Emperor.”

Wukong laughed loudly:

“Just your hand? Watch this!”

**The Famous Test:

Wukong in the Buddha’s Palm**

Wukong somersaulted into the sky, traveling 108,000 miles with a single leap.

He saw:

Five giant pillars reaching to the heavens

Endless clouds and the edge of the world

He thought:

“I’ve reached the end of the universe. I win!”

To prove it, he scribbled on one pillar:

“Great Sage Equal to Heaven was here.”
Then urinated beside it for good measure.

He somersaulted back and shouted:

“I went beyond your hand. Let me rule Heaven!”

The Buddha raised his palm and said gently:

“Look.”

In the center of his hand were:

Wukong’s bold graffiti

And the damp stain where he urinated

Wukong froze in disbelief:

“Impossible! I flew tens of thousands of miles!”

Buddha responded:

“Your powers are great, but you have never left the palm of illusion. Your mind is chaotic, your heart unrooted. Therefore, you cannot escape.”

The Buddha Subdues the Great Sage

Buddha turned his hand over and transformed it into a Five-Elements Mountain (Five-Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth).

It dropped from the heavens like a falling star and pinned Wukong underneath.

He tried to lift it.
He tried to shrink.
He tried to transform.

Nothing worked.

Five magic seals locked the mountain:

Metal restrained his bones

Wood restrained his growth

Water restrained his spirit

Fire restrained his energy

Earth restrained his body

He was trapped completely.

Buddha said:

“Let him reflect on his misdeeds. After many years, a monk will come to free him. Then he may walk the path to true enlightenment.”

Guanyin added a golden seal of restraint on Wukong’s head, preventing his escape.

Wukong Imprisoned for 500 Years

Under the mountain, Wukong shouted and cursed, but no one could hear him.

The only comfort he received was from a local Earth Spirit who brought small offerings of food and water.

For 500 years, the proud Great Sage sat in darkness.

But this imprisonment would eventually purify his heart, preparing him for his true destiny:
protecting the monk Tang Sanzang on the pilgrimage to the West.

Thus ended the era of the rebellious Great Sage,
and began the long road toward redemption.
