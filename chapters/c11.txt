**Journey to the West – Chapter 11

Tang Sanzang Frees Sun Wukong — The Monkey Becomes His Disciple**

Tang Sanzang Arrives at the Five Elements Mountain

As Tang Sanzang continues his journey westward on the white dragon horse, he reaches the base of a towering mountain. Its peaks are shrouded in clouds, and the air feels heavy with an unseen force.

This is the Five Elements Mountain, under which Sun Wukong has been trapped for 500 years. Though the Great Sage is confined, his golden eyes still gleam with fiery light, and his spirit remains untamed.

Tang Sanzang dismounts and prays:

“O Bodhisattva Guanyin, please guide me to the path of righteousness. May your wisdom lead me safely through this journey.”

The First Encounter

Suddenly, a voice booms from the mountain:

“Who dares approach my prison? Are you here to mock me?”

Tang Sanzang, startled but composed, kneels respectfully:

“Great Sage, I am a humble monk. I come to perform a righteous task — to retrieve sacred scriptures for the salvation of all beings.”

Sun Wukong, curious and suspicious, asks:

“A mortal dares speak to me so boldly? Who are you, and why should I trust you?”

Tang Sanzang explains his mission and the blessings of Guanyin Bodhisattva, who foretold that Wukong would serve as his protector.

Wukong Tests the Monk

Even after hearing this, Wukong is wary. He warns:

“I have been imprisoned for 500 years. Heaven, Earth, and even the Buddha could not subdue me. How can I serve a mere monk?”

Tang Sanzang responds with calm humility:

“Your strength and wisdom are beyond measure. I do not ask for power over you. Only that you guide and protect me on the righteous path.”

Wukong studies the monk carefully. He realizes that Tang Sanzang is sincere, compassionate, and unafraid. Slowly, the Monkey King begins to respect him.

The Golden Headband Spell

Tang Sanzang presents a magical headband given by Guanyin. He explains:

“This headband will help keep your spirit focused. When you act rashly, I may tighten it. It will teach you discipline and guide your heart toward virtue.”

Wukong laughs at first, mocking the idea, but ultimately accepts it, understanding that obedience is necessary for the mission ahead.

The Monkey Becomes a Disciple

With this agreement, Wukong kneels before Tang Sanzang and declares:

“I, Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, pledge to serve you faithfully and protect you from all harm.”

Tang Sanzang blesses him:

“From this day forward, you shall be my first disciple. Together, we shall journey westward to obtain the sacred scriptures.”

The white dragon horse, sensing the importance of the moment, bows its head in acknowledgment. Wukong climbs onto Tang Sanzang’s side, ready to accompany him.

A New Beginning

Thus, the pilgrimage officially begins:

Tang Sanzang, the pure-hearted monk, tasked with retrieving the Buddhist scriptures

Sun Wukong, the once-rebellious Great Sage, now bound by duty and discipline

The White Dragon Horse, loyal and watchful

The three move forward, leaving the Five Elements Mountain behind. Though Wukong has been freed, the path ahead promises many trials, battles with demons, and moral tests.
