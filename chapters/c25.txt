**Journey to the West – Chapter 25

The River Demon’s Trap — Wukong’s Courage and Tang Sanzang’s Patience Tested**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

After surviving the scorpion demoness, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue their journey westward. The path now leads them to a broad river with fast-flowing waters. Although the river appears calm on the surface, hidden currents and lurking demons make it extremely dangerous.

Tang Sanzang focuses on prayer, trusting in Guanyin Bodhisattva for guidance, while Sun Wukong flies ahead to scout for threats.

The River Demon Appears

A powerful river demon has been observing the travelers, waiting for an opportunity to strike. He can control water, create whirlpools, and summon aquatic illusions to confuse victims.

The demon’s plan is to:

Create illusions of a safe crossing.

Lure Tang Sanzang onto dangerous waters.

Capture the monk and consume his flesh to gain immortality and magical power.

When Tang Sanzang approaches the riverbank, the water seems deceptively calm. The river demon stirs the currents beneath the surface, ready to strike.

Wukong’s Intervention

Sun Wukong immediately detects the demon’s presence with his Fiery Golden Eyes. He flies down and warns:

“Master! Do not step into the water! This river is controlled by a demon!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates, torn between faith in Wukong’s judgment and his own compassion.

As the demon creates whirlpools and water illusions, Wukong springs into action. Using his golden-banded staff and Seventy-Two Transformations, he fights the river demon:

Wukong leaps across waves, striking the demon with precision.

He multiplies himself to attack from multiple angles.

He dispels illusions and counters the demon’s water magic.

Finally, Wukong binds the river demon with magical chains, forcing him to retreat and restoring calm to the river.

Tang Sanzang Learns a Lesson

Tang Sanzang witnesses Wukong’s bravery and skill and reflects:

“Disciple, I understand now that compassion must be guided by discernment. Mercy alone cannot overcome hidden dangers. I must trust your judgment as we face such trials.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, your virtue lights the way, but my skill and vigilance protect it. Together, we ensure the pilgrimage succeeds.”

The Pilgrimage Continues

With the river demon defeated, the travelers continue westward:

Tang Sanzang grows wiser, learning to balance virtue with discernment and trust.

Sun Wukong proves his loyalty, strength, and cleverness once again.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe passage across rivers and treacherous landscapes.

The road ahead remains dangerous, with more cunning and powerful demons awaiting the pilgrims. Each encounter strengthens their bond and prepares them for the ultimate mission of bringing the sacred scriptures safely to the Tang Empire.
