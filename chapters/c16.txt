**Journey to the West – Chapter 16

The River Demon Captures Tang Sanzang — Wukong’s Skill Saves the Day**

Continuing the Journey

After defeating the mountain demon, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue westward. The road passes through forests, rivers, and valleys. Despite the monk’s purity and diligence in prayer, the land remains full of hidden dangers: demons, spirits, and bandits seeking the sacred energy of a holy man.

Sun Wukong flies ahead, scouting and protecting the monk, while Tang Sanzang continues to meditate and pray.

The River Demon Strikes

The travelers arrive at a wide, deep river. Suddenly, a powerful river demon emerges from the waters. This demon has been lying in wait, planning to capture Tang Sanzang and devour him, believing his flesh grants immortality and spiritual power.

The demon conjures waves and illusions, making the river appear even more treacherous. Tang Sanzang, seeing only danger, prays:

“Bodhisattva Guanyin, please guide me safely across this river.”

The white dragon horse transforms into his dragon form to carry the monk across, but the demon attacks with powerful currents and magic, attempting to overturn the dragon and drag Tang Sanzang into the depths.

Wukong Takes Action

Seeing the danger, Sun Wukong swoops down with his golden-banded staff, attacking the demon. The river demon, strong and cunning, uses shapeshifting magic to evade the blows. He transforms into a giant fish, a crocodile, and even a log floating in the river.

Wukong, with his Fiery Golden Eyes, sees through each illusion. Using his staff and clever strategy, he binds the demon with magical chains, pinning it to the riverbed.

The demon thrashes violently but cannot escape. Wukong strikes it repeatedly until it retreats, leaving the river calm once again.

Tang Sanzang Learns Another Lesson

After the battle, Tang Sanzang expresses concern:

“Disciple, the demon has suffered. We should have spared it.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, these beings are dangerous. If you delay or hesitate, the journey will fail. Mercy is important, but discernment is essential.”

Tang Sanzang nods, realizing that true compassion sometimes requires relying on the strength and wisdom of others.

The Journey Continues

With the river safe, Tang Sanzang rides the white dragon horse across the waters. Sun Wukong flies above, scanning for additional threats. The group rests briefly, offering prayers for the spirits they encounter along the way.

The trio moves forward, strengthened by their shared experiences:

Tang Sanzang grows wiser, learning when to trust his disciples and balance mercy with caution.

Sun Wukong proves his unwavering loyalty and skill in protecting the monk.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe passage across treacherous terrain.

The path to the West remains perilous, with greater challenges, more cunning demons, and moral tests waiting to test their courage, intelligence, and virtue.
