**Journey to the West – Chapter 8

Guanyin Finds a Monk; Wukong’s Redemption Begins**

After wreaking havoc in Heaven, Sun Wukong is finally subdued by the Buddha and trapped beneath the Five Elements Mountain. The stone mountain seals him tightly, leaving only his head exposed. Unable to move, he must wait for the destined person who will free him and lead him on the path to enlightenment.

Guanyin’s Mission

Meanwhile, on Mount Potalaka, the Bodhisattva Guanyin receives a divine command:
she is to travel to the Eastern Land (China) to find a monk who will journey to the West and bring back the true Buddhist scriptures to save all living beings.

Guanyin sets off with her disciple, the Golden-Headed Fish Monk. Along the way, she encounters many demons and restless spirits. Some of them have escaped from Heaven or the underworld; others desire power or immortality. Guanyin instructs each one to wait along the road to the Western Heaven. If a scripture-seeking monk arrives, they must test him—but not kill him. These “tests” will become the future trials of Tang Sanzang and his disciples.

Encounter with the Tiger Spirit

Arriving in a remote mountain forest, Guanyin meets a tiger demon attacking travelers. She subdues it immediately, warning it to cease harming humans. If the destined monk comes by, it may test but not devour him. The tiger bows and agrees.

A Prophecy for a Future Disciple

Continuing her journey, Guanyin hears of a virtuous monk named Xuanzang (later known as Tang Sanzang), who lives in the Great Tang Empire. He is pure-hearted, compassionate, and diligent in meditation—the perfect candidate for the scripture mission.

She decides he will be the one.

Meeting the Trapped Wukong

Guanyin eventually reaches the Five Elements Mountain. Sun Wukong recognizes her divine aura and calls out for help. He admits his past rebellion but begs for freedom.

Guanyin tells him:

“If you wish to be released, you must repent and guard the monk on his journey to the West. Serve faithfully, protect him from harm, and earn merit.”

Wukong agrees eagerly, promising to change his ways. Guanyin smiles, knowing his cunning nature, and prepares precautions to ensure he behaves once freed—this will later become the Golden Headband Spell (紧箍咒).

Guanyin Meets the Tang Emperor

Finally reaching Chang’an, Guanyin appears at the imperial court in disguise. She tells Emperor Taizong of a distant Western paradise, where true scriptures can bring peace and salvation to the world. Inspired, the emperor orders that a monk be chosen to travel to India and retrieve them.

Xuanzang is selected.

Unknown to him, his journey will lead him to meet Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, and the White Dragon Horse, forming the legendary “Four Protectors of the Sutras.”
