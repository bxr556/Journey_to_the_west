**Journey to the West – Chapter 27

Pigsy’s First Trial — Laziness and Greed on the Road**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

With Pigsy now accepted as a disciple, the small band of pilgrims grows livelier and more complicated. Tang Sanzang rides the white dragon horse at the center. Sun Wukong scouts ahead, alert for demons. Pigsy lumbers behind, carrying luggage, grumbling about hunger and fatigue.

Tang Sanzang is pleased to see another being step onto the path of redemption. Wukong, however, keeps a close eye on Pigsy, uncertain whether the former marshal has truly changed his ways.

The Temptation of Comfort

One evening, as the group travels through rolling hills, dark clouds gather and rain begins to fall. The path turns muddy, and the wind howls through the trees. Tang Sanzang suggests they look for a place to take shelter.

Soon they spot a small manor house with lanterns glowing warmly in the distance. Pigsy is overjoyed at the sight of a roof, dry ground, and the possibility of food. Wukong, wary as ever, advises caution, reminding everyone that demons often hide behind fine walls and polite manners.

The manor’s owner, appearing as a courteous host, invites them in, offers them seats, and orders servants to bring out hot tea and food. Tang Sanzang, grateful for the hospitality, begins to relax. Pigsy eats greedily, praising the host’s generosity.

Suspicion and Discovery

While the others rest, Sun Wukong secretly uses his Fiery Golden Eyes to examine their surroundings. He notices faint traces of demonic aura:

The servants move without true human warmth.
The food glows with an unnatural sheen.
The host’s shadow on the wall does not match his human form.

Quietly, Wukong confronts Pigsy, warning him that something is wrong. Pigsy, full and content, dismisses the concerns, claiming that Wukong is overly suspicious and jealous of his enjoyment.

The Demon Reveals Itself

When Tang Sanzang begins evening prayers, the illusion drops. The host and servants transform into grotesque demons, surrounding the monk. They bind him with enchanted ropes and prepare to cook him, believing his flesh will grant them spiritual power.

Pigsy, startled and ashamed, realizes that his desire for comfort and food blinded him to the danger. His carelessness placed his master in the hands of demons.

Wukong’s Response and Pigsy’s Shame

Sun Wukong immediately springs into action. Using his golden-banded staff, he smashes through the demonic ranks. With his transformations, he creates multiple copies of himself to confuse the enemy, while his Fiery Golden Eyes reveal which figures are real and which are illusions.

Pigsy, still clumsy but sincere in his regret, joins the fight with his nine-toothed rake. Together, they break the enchantments, scatter the demons, and free Tang Sanzang.

The demons attempt to flee, transforming into smoke and shadows, but Wukong’s blows shatter their forms, driving them away from the manor. The building itself collapses, revealing its true nature as a lair built upon stolen offerings and the bones of past victims.

Lessons for Pigsy

After the danger has passed, Tang Sanzang thanks Wukong for his vigilance and bravery. He then turns to Pigsy, who kneels in shame.

Tang Sanzang explains that the path of a disciple requires effort, restraint, and an awareness of how one’s weaknesses can endanger others. Pigsy’s laziness and greed nearly cost the monk his life.

Pigsy swears to do better, acknowledging that his gluttony and love of comfort remain powerful temptations. He promises to listen more carefully to Wukong’s warnings and to remember his vow of redemption.

The Journey Continues

As dawn breaks, the travelers leave the ruined manor behind. The rain has stopped, and the path ahead glistens with morning light.

Tang Sanzang deepens his resolve to guide his disciples not only with compassion but also with clear teaching.
Sun Wukong’s vigilance is reaffirmed as essential to the pilgrimage.
Pigsy begins to understand that true repentance means constant effort against old habits.
The white dragon horse carries the monk steadily forward, unshaken by the night’s events.

Together, they move on, with Pigsy’s first major lesson written not in words, but in the danger narrowly escaped.
