**Journey to the West – Chapter 13

The White Bone Demon Appears — Tang Sanzang Faces a Deadly Trial**

Continuing the Journey

After crossing the river safely, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue westward. The path winds through forests and mountains. Though the road seems peaceful, danger lurks everywhere. Many demons covet the monk’s flesh, believing it grants immortality and immense spiritual power.

Sun Wukong remains vigilant, flying ahead to scout for threats, while Tang Sanzang maintains his focus on prayer and meditation.

The White Bone Demon’s Plot

In a dark forest, a cunning demoness called Baigujing (the White Bone Demon) observes the travelers. She has already devoured many mortals and spirits and now seeks the monk. Her plan:

Capture Tang Sanzang.

Eat his flesh to gain immortality.

Use her shape-shifting magic to trick and confuse the travelers.

That night, she transforms into a beautiful village woman and approaches the monk, carrying a basket of food.

“Dear traveler, you must be tired from your journey. Please accept my hospitality.”

Tang Sanzang, naive and compassionate, is initially suspicious but cannot resist helping the “poor woman.” He reaches out to offer kindness.

Wukong Detects the Illusion

Sun Wukong’s Fiery Golden Eyes immediately see through the demoness’s disguise. He flies down and shouts:

“Master, beware! This is no ordinary woman — it is the White Bone Demon!”

Before Tang Sanzang can react, Wukong strikes with his golden staff, aiming to kill the demon. However, the demon uses her magic to vanish into smoke and escape.

Tang Sanzang, seeing the destruction, is horrified:

“Disciple! How could you attack an innocent woman? This is not the righteous way!”

He scolds Wukong, blaming him for violence and cruelty, though unaware of the demon’s true nature.

The Demon’s Trickery Repeats

Baigujing is clever and patient. Over the next two encounters, she changes forms again:

First, she appears as a frail old woman carrying a child.

Second, as a grieving widow searching for her husband.

Each time, Wukong recognizes her as the demon and attacks, but Tang Sanzang sees only innocent people suffering. The monk becomes increasingly angry with Wukong:

“Disciple, you must not kill without reason! I cannot permit further bloodshed.”

Wukong protests, frustrated:

“Master, these are demons! They are trying to eat you! Why do you defend them?”

The tension between the monk and his disciple grows. This teaches an early lesson of the pilgrimage: blind compassion can be dangerous without discernment.

Lesson Learned

After the third encounter, Wukong captures the demon in her true form, forcing her to retreat. Tang Sanzang finally realizes that Wukong’s warnings were justified.

He reflects:

“Though my heart seeks mercy for all, the world contains many who disguise themselves with evil intent. I must trust my disciple’s wisdom.”

Sun Wukong, ever vigilant, continues to guard the monk while understanding that patience is needed to teach him discernment.

The Journey Continues

With the White Bone Demon temporarily driven away, the trio moves forward:

Tang Sanzang learns the difficult balance between compassion and caution.

Sun Wukong proves the value of skill, insight, and vigilance.

The White Dragon Horse carries the monk safely, ready to face further obstacles.

The path to the West remains perilous, filled with stronger demons, illusions, and tests of virtue that will challenge each traveler in new ways.
