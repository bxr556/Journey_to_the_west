**Journey to the West – Chapter 10

Tang Sanzang Encounters Danger — The White Horse Revealed**

Tang Sanzang Travels Alone

After leaving Chang’an, Tang Sanzang begins his journey westward. He travels on foot, accompanied by two imperial guards. The road is long, winding through forests, mountains, and rivers.

Although the scenery is beautiful, danger lurks everywhere. Bandits, demons, and spirits roam the land, testing the monk’s resolve.

The First Demon Encounter

One day, Tang Sanzang and his escorts arrive at a river. Suddenly, a raging river demon appears, blocking their path. The demon, a shape-shifter, attacks, aiming to capture the monk and feast on his flesh — a common motif in later chapters, representing that demons seek spiritual energy.

The two imperial guards fight bravely but are no match for the demon’s magic. Tang Sanzang, pure-hearted but unarmed, prays to Guanyin Bodhisattva for protection.

Guanyin’s voice reaches him in a dream:

“Do not fear. Help will come from the east. Follow the path and trust in destiny.”

The White Horse Appears

As the demon lunges, a white dragon spirit emerges from the river. The dragon was previously transformed into a human by Guanyin’s guidance. He bows before Tang Sanzang, explaining:

“I am the son of the Dragon King of the West Sea.
I have been tasked to serve you as your steed.
Climb upon my back, and I will carry you safely across rivers and obstacles.”

Tang Sanzang mounts the dragon, which transforms into a magnificent white horse. The imperial guards watch in amazement as the horse leaps over mountains and rivers, evading the demon.

The dragon explains that Tang Sanzang must endure hardships, as the journey to the West will be long and full of trials.

The Monk’s Steadfast Resolve

Riding the white horse, Tang Sanzang reflects:

“Although the path is perilous, my mission is to retrieve the sacred scriptures for all living beings. I must not falter.”

The horse’s guidance ensures that he avoids immediate danger, but the journey ahead promises encounters with demons, tests of patience, and moral trials.

The Stage Is Set

Thus begins the official pilgrimage:

Tang Sanzang, the pure-hearted monk

The white dragon, now his loyal steed

Their journey will soon intersect with the imprisoned Sun Wukong, who will become the monk’s first disciple and protector once released from the Five Elements Mountain.

The story now moves from Tang Sanzang’s preparation and divine protection to the fateful meeting that will assemble the legendary companions of the Westward pilgrimage.
