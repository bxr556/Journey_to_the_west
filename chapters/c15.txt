**Journey to the West – Chapter 15

The Mountain Demon Tests Tang Sanzang — Wukong’s Loyalty Shines**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue their journey westward. The road passes through deep mountains and dense forests. Though the path seems peaceful at first, the land is full of cunning demons who seek to capture the monk and eat his flesh, believing it will grant immortality and supernatural power.

Sun Wukong remains vigilant, flying ahead to scout, while Tang Sanzang focuses on prayer and meditation.

The Mountain Demon Appears

The travelers arrive at a large, rocky mountain. From the shadows emerges a mountain demon, a powerful shape-shifter who can take the form of humans or animals. This demon has been watching the monk’s journey and devises a plan:

Transform into an innocent person in need.

Gain Tang Sanzang’s trust.

Capture him at the perfect moment.

The demon first appears as an old woodcutter, bowing respectfully and asking for food. Tang Sanzang, ever compassionate, offers him rice and water, not suspecting the danger.

Wukong Sees Through the Illusion

Sun Wukong immediately senses the demon’s true identity. He warns Tang Sanzang:

“Master, this is no ordinary man. It is a demon in disguise. Prepare yourself!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates, unsure whether Wukong is speaking the truth. He struggles with his innate compassion, reluctant to believe anyone could be a demon.

Wukong grows frustrated:

“Master, if you delay, we will be attacked! Please trust me this once!”

The Battle Ensues

The demon, realizing Wukong has discovered him, attacks with tremendous strength and magic:

The mountain quakes as boulders fly.

Trees are uprooted.

Magical flames and smoke fill the area.

Wukong uses his golden staff and Seventy-Two Transformations to counter the demon’s tricks. He multiplies himself into hundreds of clones, surrounding and striking the demon from all directions.

Finally, Wukong traps the mountain demon in a powerful binding spell. The demon struggles but cannot escape.

Tang Sanzang Learns Trust

Seeing the demon captured, Tang Sanzang finally understands the wisdom of Wukong’s warnings. He bows deeply:

“Disciple, I see now that your vigilance and skill are invaluable. I must learn to trust your judgment.”

Wukong smiles, feeling proud yet humble. He reminds Tang Sanzang:

“Master, my purpose is to protect you. On this journey, there will be countless trials. Trust and cooperation are our greatest weapons.”

The Journey Continues

With the mountain demon defeated, the trio rests briefly. They offer prayers for the spirit of the demon, releasing it to the afterlife.

The journey resumes:

Tang Sanzang grows wiser, learning to balance compassion with discernment.

Sun Wukong proves his loyalty, courage, and strength once again.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe passage across rivers and mountains.

The road to the West remains perilous. Each trial will test not only physical strength but also morality, patience, and wisdom, preparing the travelers for the ultimate challenges ahead.
