**Journey to the West – Chapter 12

The White Horse Crosses the River — Tang Sanzang Meets His First Demonic Trial**

Continuing the Journey

After leaving the Five Elements Mountain, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse travel westward. The road stretches endlessly over mountains, rivers, and forests. Though the monk is pure-hearted, the land is filled with hidden dangers: demons, spirits, and ill-intentioned beings who crave the energy of a holy man.

Sun Wukong remains vigilant, watching for any threats, while Tang Sanzang focuses on prayer and meditation, keeping his mind calm.

The First River Crossing

The trio soon reaches a wide, rushing river. The water is swift, and the riverbank is steep. Tang Sanzang dismounts and prays:

“O Bodhisattva Guanyin, please guide me across safely. Let no evil hinder this righteous journey.”

The white dragon horse steps into the water, transforming into a dragon to ferry the monk across. Sun Wukong flies overhead, scanning the area for dangers.

A Hidden Demon Appears

Unbeknownst to them, a river demon has taken note of the monk. This demon disguises itself as an old ferryman, waiting to ambush travelers. It plans to capture Tang Sanzang and devour him, believing that consuming his flesh will grant immortality.

The demon calls out sweetly:

“Dear traveler, the river is dangerous. Let me help you cross safely.”

Tang Sanzang, trusting in the divine guidance of Guanyin, hesitates briefly but senses no immediate threat. He steps onto the ferryman’s boat.

Wukong Intervenes

Sun Wukong, however, notices the ferryman’s true form: claws, fangs, and eyes glowing red. He immediately flies down, brandishing his golden staff.

“Foul demon! You dare attack my master? Prepare yourself!”

A fierce battle erupts. The demon is powerful, with shape-shifting abilities, trying to confuse Wukong. But Wukong, with his Seventy-Two Transformations and Fiery Golden Eyes, sees through every illusion.

The monkey strikes the demon with his staff, sending it fleeing into the depths of the river. The water churns, and the boat is saved from capsizing.

Tang Sanzang Learns a Lesson

Grateful but still unaware of the full danger, Tang Sanzang bows repeatedly to Wukong:

“Disciple, I see your courage and wisdom. I rely on you to protect me on this journey.”

Wukong smiles but remains cautious. He warns:

“Master, there are many demons ahead. We must not be complacent.”

The white dragon horse carries Tang Sanzang safely across the river, while Wukong keeps a watchful eye on the surroundings.

The Journey Ahead

This first trial sets the pattern for the pilgrimage:

Tang Sanzang provides spiritual guidance and prayer.

Sun Wukong provides strength, protection, and insight.

The white dragon horse provides safe transport across treacherous terrain.

Although the river crossing was minor compared to the dangers to come, it is the first test of the monk’s resolve and the Great Sage’s loyalty.

The trio presses onward, unaware of the more cunning demons and magical obstacles that await on the journey to the West.
