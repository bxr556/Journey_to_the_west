**Journey to the West — Chapter 4

Appointed “Protector of the Horses,” Sun Wukong Is Dissatisfied —
He Declares Himself “Great Sage Equal to Heaven”**

After the uproar in the underworld, the Heavenly Court received reports of Sun Wukong’s growing power. The Jade Emperor listened as celestial officials warned:

“This monkey has erased his name from the Book of Life and Death. He is bold and unrestrained. If left alone, he may cause serious trouble.”

Some suggested sending heavenly troops to eliminate him. But Taibai Jinxing, the Grand Minister, offered another solution:

“Your Majesty, Sun Wukong is strong, but he is ignorant and unschooled. If we bring him to Heaven and give him a small official post, he will feel honored and become easier to manage.”

The Jade Emperor agreed.

Taibai Jinxing descended to Flower-Fruit Mountain. When Wukong saw the heavenly envoy, he greeted him respectfully. Jinxing announced:

“The Jade Emperor has heard of your talents and invites you to Heaven to take office.”

Wukong was thrilled:

“A position in Heaven! At last I will have true status.”

He mounted a cloud and followed Jinxing to the gates of Heaven, admiring the celestial palaces and shimmering towers. They led him to the Hall of Divine Radiance, where the Jade Emperor appointed him:

“Bi Ma Wen — Protector of the Imperial Stables.”

Wukong bowed gratefully, unaware that this was a menial job — essentially a horse caretaker.

He went to the stables and fulfilled his duties with enthusiasm, feeding celestial horses and grooming them. However, after a few days he began to wonder why no one saluted him, why his rank seemed low, and why the other immortals laughed behind his back.

One day, he overheard two star officials whispering:

“That Sun Wukong thinks he has earned glory in Heaven, but he’s just a stable boy — the lowest official here!”

Hearing this, Wukong exploded with rage.

“The Jade Emperor deceived me! I won’t stay to be mocked!”

He smashed the stable gate, leapt onto a cloud, and flew straight back to Flower-Fruit Mountain.

The Jade Emperor soon heard that Sun Wukong had abandoned his post. Some ministers urged immediate punishment, but others advised caution. Taibai Jinxing again said:

“Your Majesty, let me persuade him once more. It could avoid unnecessary conflict.”

Back at Flower-Fruit Mountain

Wukong gathered all the monkeys and declared:

“Heaven only made me a horse keeper — a humiliating title! From today on, I will write my own destiny.”

He carved three large characters onto a stone:

“Great Sage Equal to Heaven.”（齐天大圣）

The monkeys cheered wildly. Wukong built a grand court, set guards, and declared independence from Heaven.

Heaven Responds

In Heaven, the Jade Emperor considered sending armies, but Taibai Jinxing again intervened:

“Your Majesty, instead of fighting him, why not simply grant him the title he wants? Call him the ‘Great Sage Equal to Heaven,’ but assign him a harmless post. This will keep him busy and peaceful.”

The Jade Emperor agreed.

Taibai Jinxing returned to Flower-Fruit Mountain and said:

“The Jade Emperor recognizes your title of Great Sage Equal to Heaven and invites you back to assume your role officially.”

Wukong was delighted:

“At last Heaven respects me!”

He traveled back to Heaven, where a grand plaque was hung:

“Residence of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.”

It was an empty office with no real duties, created merely to appease him. But Wukong didn’t realize that — he felt honored.

He lounged happily in his new mansion, ate celestial peaches, and enjoyed leisurely days, thinking:

“This is the life I deserve.”

A New Problem in Heaven

However, one day the immortals in charge of the Peach Garden — where peaches of immortality grow — complained:

“Sun Wukong has been sneaking into the garden, eating peaches and disturbing the fairies. We must report this!”

The Jade Emperor frowned:

“This monkey’s wild nature is showing again.”

And thus, the stage was set for the next conflict — one that would lead to the famous Havoc in Heaven.
