**Journey to the West – Chapter 14

The Dragon Prince Becomes Tang Sanzang’s Steed —
Trials on the Road Continue**

Continuing the Journey

After the terrifying encounter with the White Bone Demon, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue westward. The road winds through mountains, forests, and plains, and the monk remains deeply focused on prayer and meditation.

Though the White Bone Demon has been temporarily driven away, other hidden dangers and spirits lie ahead, watching for a chance to strike. Sun Wukong remains alert, flying ahead to scout and protect the group.

The Dragon Prince’s Story

The white dragon horse, who carries Tang Sanzang, is revealed to be a dragon prince of the West Sea. He had been punished for a past offense and transformed into a white horse to serve as the monk’s steed.

He explains to Tang Sanzang:

“I have been assigned by Guanyin Bodhisattva to carry you safely across treacherous rivers and lands. Though I am bound in this form, I shall serve faithfully, and my loyalty will protect you.”

Tang Sanzang bows in gratitude, promising to treat the horse with respect and care.

First Major Obstacle: River Demon

Soon, the travelers arrive at another river, swollen from recent rains. As they approach, a river demon rises from the waters. He is huge and terrifying, with sharp teeth and glowing eyes, seeking to capture Tang Sanzang.

The river demon attacks with water blasts and magic, attempting to drown the travelers. The white dragon horse transforms into his dragon form to ferry Tang Sanzang safely across the river.

Sun Wukong, flying overhead, strikes the demon with his golden staff. The river demon fights fiercely, creating massive waves, but Wukong’s skill and strength are unmatched.

With a final blow, Wukong defeats the demon, sending it back into the depths of the river. The travelers continue onward safely.

Lessons Learned

The encounter reinforces key lessons for Tang Sanzang and his disciples:

Tang Sanzang learns the importance of discernment: while compassion is vital, he must rely on the guidance and protection of those with worldly and spiritual experience.

Sun Wukong continues to prove his loyalty and skill, showing that strength and vigilance are essential on the perilous journey.

The White Dragon Horse demonstrates that past mistakes and punishments can be transformed into service for a righteous purpose.

The Journey Continues

After crossing the river safely, the travelers rest briefly, replenishing their energy and supplies. Tang Sanzang prays for the souls of those they encounter and asks for guidance from Guanyin Bodhisattva.

The road ahead promises more demons, spirits, and tests of virtue. Each encounter will not only challenge their physical strength but also test their morality, patience, and wisdom.

The pilgrimage continues, moving ever closer to the Western Paradise, and the bonds between Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse grow stronger with each trial.
