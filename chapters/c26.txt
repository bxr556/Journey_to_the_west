**Journey to the West – Chapter 26

Pigsy at Gao Village — The Gluttonous Demon Becomes a Disciple**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

After surviving many river and mountain demons, Tang Sanzang and Sun Wukong continue westward with the white dragon horse. The road now leads them away from desolate valleys and into cultivated farmland. Villages dot the landscape, yet fear lingers in the air; rumors of demons have traveled faster than the monk himself.

Tang Sanzang remains focused on prayer and compassion, while Wukong scouts ahead, wary of any hidden threats. Though they have overcome many dangers, the monk still believes that every being can be redeemed, whereas Wukong trusts vigilance over sentiment.

Gao Village in Distress

Near sunset, the travelers arrive at a prosperous-looking place known as Gao Village. The fields are fertile, but the villagers’ faces are anxious. When they see Tang Sanzang, they quickly invite the pilgrims to the home of Elder Gao, the village head.

Elder Gao explains that a powerful pig demon has been terrorizing the village. The creature, half-man and half-boar, eats enormous amounts of grain, drinks whole jars of wine, and has forced itself into the elder’s household, insisting on marrying his daughter. None of the local warriors or hired fighters have been able to defeat it.

Tang Sanzang feels compassion for the villagers and wishes to resolve the matter peacefully. Sun Wukong, however, recognizes that a gluttonous, violent creature will not be persuaded by kind words alone. He offers to drive the demon away and protect the village.

The Pig Demon Revealed

That night, the pig demon returns to Elder Gao’s estate. He is huge, with a snout, tusks, and bristling hair, wielding a nine-toothed rake. Boasting of his strength, he demands food and wine and calls for the elder’s daughter.

Disguised as the young woman, Wukong lures the demon outside. When the moment is right, he sheds his disguise, brandishes his golden-banded staff, and challenges the pig demon. A fierce battle erupts in the courtyard and fields beyond.

The pig demon is strong but clumsy; his attacks rely on brute force rather than skill. Wukong, quick and agile, dodges the blows, counters with precise strikes, and uses his transformations to confuse his opponent. After many exchanges, the pig demon can no longer keep up.

A Fallen Marshal Repents

Realizing he is outmatched, the pig demon attempts to flee into the hills. Wukong pursues him, pressing him to surrender. Cornered and exhausted, the demon finally speaks of his past.

He reveals that he was once Marshal Tian Peng, a commander in Heaven, but was cast down for misconduct and reborn in this form. Having taken refuge in the mortal world, he succumbed to laziness, gluttony, and desire, becoming the terror of Gao Village.

At that moment, the earlier instructions of Guanyin Bodhisattva are recalled: a pig spirit is destined to become Tang Sanzang’s disciple, if only he repents and agrees to aid the pilgrimage. Hearing this, the former marshal kneels, begging for a chance at redemption.

Tang Sanzang’s Compassion and Wukong’s Caution

Brought back before Tang Sanzang, the pig demon bows repeatedly and asks to follow the monk on his journey, promising to protect him and atone for his sins. Tang Sanzang, moved by the story of his fall from grace, agrees to accept him as a disciple, giving him the name Zhu Bajie, or Pigsy.

Sun Wukong remains cautious. He warns Pigsy that the pilgrimage requires discipline, restraint, and loyalty. Any return to old habits will not be tolerated.

The New Companion

With Gao Village freed from its tormentor and Elder Gao’s household at peace, the villagers offer thanks and provisions. Tang Sanzang prays for the pig spirit’s transformation from greed to service, while Wukong remains watchful.

The pilgrims depart with a new companion:

Tang Sanzang, whose compassion guides the group.
Sun Wukong, whose vigilance and strength defend the path.
Zhu Bajie, the reformed pig demon, learning to master his appetites.
The white dragon horse, steadfast steed and silent guardian.

Together, they resume their westward journey, unaware of the many trials that will test this newly formed brotherhood.
