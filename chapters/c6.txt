《第六回：观音赴会问原因 如来示法收大圣》
This chapter centers on the legendary battle between Sun Wukong and Erlang Shen.

**Journey to the West — Chapter 6

Guanyin Inquires into the Chaos —
The Buddha Provides a Method;
Erlang Shen Battles the Great Sage**

After Sun Wukong defeated Heaven’s armies, the celestial halls were in an uproar. The Jade Emperor convened an emergency assembly of gods, immortals, and guardians. Guanyin Bodhisattva also arrived to attend the meeting.

She bowed and asked:

“Why has Heaven fallen into such disorder? What creature dares challenge the Celestial Court?”

The Jade Emperor explained the entire situation:
Sun Wukong had eaten the peaches of immortality, stolen Laozi’s elixir, wrecked the Peach Banquet, and defeated all heavenly generals.

Guanyin said calmly:

“Heaven’s methods are not enough. You need the help of someone truly capable.”

At that moment, Erlang Shen, the True Immortal with the Third-Eye of Truth, stepped forward. He was famous for his strength, transformations, and battlefield strategy.

He declared:

“I will bring back the Monkey.”

The Jade Emperor agreed and sent Erlang Shen with his elite Seven Saints and a host of divine hounds and soldiers.

Erlang Shen Descends

Erlang Shen descended from Heaven on auspicious clouds, accompanied by his loyal companions:

The Seven Brothers of Plum Mountain

His Howling Heaven Hound

A battalion of fierce spirit soldiers

They arrived at Flower-Fruit Mountain, where Wukong stood atop a peak, spinning his gold-banded staff, surrounded by cheering monkeys.

Wukong shouted:

“Who are you? Another fool from Heaven trying to catch me?”

Erlang Shen answered confidently:

“I am Erlang Shen, nephew of the Jade Emperor. Your crimes defy Heaven. Surrender now!”

Wukong laughed wildly:

“If you want me, come take me yourself!”

The Battle Begins

The sky darkened as the two warriors clashed.

Wukong swung his staff; Erlang blocked with his three-pointed spear. Thunder clashed as their weapons met. Sparks lit the sky. Mountains shook.

Both armies watched in awe as the two immortals battled evenly, neither gaining advantage.

The Shape-Shifting Duel

Realizing brute force wasn’t enough, Wukong shouted:

“Let’s see if your transformations match mine!”

He transformed into:

A soaring eagle

A roaring tiger

A giant fish diving into the sea

A massive temple bell rolling down the mountainside

Erlang shifted effortlessly to match:

A hawk piercing the clouds

A divine hound chasing prey

A dragon cutting through waves

A towering golden pillar crushing the bell

The fight shook heaven and earth.
Even the Jade Emperor watched anxiously from the Lingxiao Palace.

Wukong Tries to Flee

After hundreds of transformations, Wukong saw that Erlang Shen was just as skilled. He tried to escape.

He transformed into:

A tiny sparrow, fluttering away.

But Erlang Shen opened his Third Eye, revealing the true form hidden beneath illusions. He commanded:

“Hound! After him!”

The divine hound leapt high, snapping at the sparrow. Startled, Wukong turned into a large tree. Erlang responded by turning into a woodsman with an axe.

Wukong became a temple. Erlang became a monk and set fire beneath it.

Finally, Wukong transformed into a small housefly and buzzed into Erlang’s sleeve—trying to hide.

But Erlang sensed him, grabbed at his arm, and shouted:

“Got you!”

Wukong popped out of the sleeve, reverting to his true form, and the battle resumed.

Heaven Intervenes

Meanwhile, the Four Heavenly Kings and Li Jing re-entered the fight, surrounding Wukong on all sides.

Wukong used the Body-Dividing Technique, producing hundreds of clones, each wielding a staff. But Erlang Shen was seasoned in war; he commanded his troops to form formations and break through Wukong’s illusions.

Still, the Monkey King refused to yield.

Laozi Helps Capture Wukong

Seeing the stalemate, Laozi, the Supreme Elder, arrived carrying his Diamond Snare.

He threw the magical ring from the clouds, and it struck Wukong squarely on the head. The blow stunned him, and in that moment Erlang Shen lunged forward, pinning him beneath his spear.

Heavenly soldiers swarmed in and tied Wukong with golden cords.

Wukong roared:

“Just wait! I’ll break free sooner or later!”

But the gods had finally captured him.

Judgment in Heaven

The heavenly troops dragged Wukong back to the Celestial Court. Some gods called for immediate execution, but others hesitated:

“He has eaten peaches, elixir pills, divine wine, and he was forged by Heaven and Earth… normal punishments may not work.”

Laozi stepped forward:

“Let me handle him. Place him into my Eight-Trigram Furnace. The Samadhi True Fire will melt him down.”

The Jade Emperor agreed.

Wukong was carried off to Laozi’s furnace, where he would burn for 49 days.

But no one expected what the fire would actually do…

It would not kill the Monkey King—
it would make him even stronger.
