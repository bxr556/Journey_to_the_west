All Realms Submit; Sun Wukong Erases His Name from the Book of Life**

After leaving Patriarch Bodhi, Sun Wukong traveled back to the Eastern Continent. Using the Cloud-Somersault he had learned, he returned to Flower-Fruit Mountain in a single bound. The monkeys saw him descending from the clouds and rushed forward in excitement:

“Our king has returned!”

Wukong greeted them warmly and told them of his travels — how he had become a disciple of a great immortal and mastered divine abilities. The monkeys were overjoyed.

Soon after returning, enemies appeared. A powerful demon named the Havoc-Wreaking Demon King had invaded Flower-Fruit Mountain, seized the Water-Curtain Cave, and bullied the monkey clan. When he saw Wukong return, he laughed mockingly:

“A mere monkey dares challenge me?”

But Wukong, confident in his skills, stepped forward. Using his newfound strength, he fought the demon fiercely. With a single powerful strike of his gold-banded staff, he killed the demon king and reclaimed the cave. The monkeys cheered as their home was restored.

From then on, Wukong gathered all the nearby monkey tribes and declared himself:

“The Handsome Monkey King.”

He trained his subjects, set up patrols, organized the mountain, and declared independence from the rule of mortals. The mountain became peaceful and prosperous — until one night, demons began whispering:

“The Monkey King has lived too long. If he is not careful, he will eventually face death just like all beings.”

These words bothered Wukong deeply. He thought:

“Though I have learned the Way, my lifespan is still bound by the laws of the underworld. I must break free from birth and death.”

Not long after, while sleeping, Wukong felt strange hands pulling him. Two ghostly attendants — black and white, the Envoys of Death — chained him and dragged him to the Underworld, saying:

“Sun Wukong, your time is up. It is your turn to report to the courts of the dead.”

Wukong became enraged:

“Nonsense! I have cultivated the Way — how dare you summon me?”

They pulled him before King Yama’s hall. Ten kings of the underworld examined the case. Wukong shouted:

“Who dares send for me?”

The ghostly officials trembled:

“It was the register of life and death. It listed your time as expired.”

Furious, Wukong grabbed a judge’s brush and stormed into the Record Hall. Bookshelves full of ledgers recorded the life and death of all beings. Wukong searched until he found the volume for the Monkey Clan.

He roared:

“Why should monkeys be bound by your rules?”

Without hesitation, he crossed out the entire entry for monkeys, erasing their names and removing all fate of death.

The judges cried out:

“You cannot alter the Book of Life and Death!”

But Wukong slammed his staff and shattered the hall.

Chaos erupted. Underworld soldiers surrounded him, but none could stop him. His body was too strong, his magic too great. Before long, he broke free of the underworld and leapt back to the world of the living.

Waking suddenly from his sleep, he found that he had returned to Flower-Fruit Mountain, entirely unharmed. The monkeys gathered around him, confused. Wukong laughed:

“I have erased all our names from the Book of Death. We will no longer be bound by fate!”

From that day forward, the Monkey King and all monkeys of Flower-Fruit Mountain enjoyed long lives and freedom from mortal constraints.

But the uproar Wukong caused in the underworld reached the Heavenly Court. The celestial officers reported:

“Sun Wukong has erased his name from the Book of Life and Death and caused havoc in the underworld. His powers are growing unchecked.”

Jade Emperor frowned:

“This monkey is becoming dangerous. We must discuss how to deal with him.”

And so, Heaven began planning how to bring Sun Wukong under control — setting the stage for the battles soon to come.
