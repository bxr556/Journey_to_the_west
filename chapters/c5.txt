《第五回：乱蟠桃大圣偷丹 反天宫诸神捉怪》

**Journey to the West — Chapter 5

The Great Sage Creates Chaos at the Peach Banquet —
He Steals the Elixir and Defies Heaven;
Heaven’s Armies Are Sent to Capture Him**

After being granted the empty title “Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” Sun Wukong lived freely in Heaven. His only assigned duty was to guard the Peach Garden, but he treated it like his personal orchard. The divine peaches came in three varieties:

Small peaches ripen every 3,000 years — eating them grants longevity.

Middle peaches ripen every 6,000 years — eating them grants lightness of body and immortality.

Large peaches ripen every 9,000 years — eating them grants eternal youth and the ability to ascend beyond the mortal realm.

Wukong tasted them all.

He climbed trees, plucked the ripest peaches, and ate them without permission. The Seven Fairy Maidens—who managed the garden—eventually discovered that the peaches were missing. They went to report the problem to the Queen Mother of the West.

The Queen Mother’s Peach Banquet

The Queen Mother had been preparing for her grand Peach Banquet, inviting all major deities:
the Jade Emperor, Laozi, the Four Heavenly Kings, the Eight Immortals, star gods, river gods, mountain gods, and countless others.

But when the fairies reported that peaches were missing and that the Great Sage had been eating them, the Queen Mother was upset:

“The banquet is in three days! How can this happen? Find him—now!”

She ordered the Seven Fairies to invite guests as usual but insisted that someone watch the Peach Garden closely.

Sun Wukong Disguises Himself

The Seven Fairies went to the Great Sage’s residence to deliver invitations, but he wasn’t there. Wukong had transformed himself into a small fairy and overheard their conversation. When they flew off, he laughed:

“A Peach Banquet? And I wasn’t invited? I’ll attend anyway!”

He transformed into a fairy maiden, entered the Peach Banquet pavilion, and found tables full of rare wine, spirit fruits, and celestial delicacies. Since the banquet had not yet begun, nobody else was there.

Wukong muttered:

“Why wait for them?”

He sat down boldly and drank the immortal wine. Table after table, he emptied the cups and ate the delicacies.

Wukong Steals the Elixir Pills

Still unsatisfied, he thought:

“The peaches are eaten, the wine is drunk… what else does Heaven have?”

He remembered Laozi’s alchemy furnace, so he sneaked into the Great Supreme Elder’s alchemy chamber. The door was unguarded because everyone was preparing for the banquet.

Inside, he found gourdfuls of Nine-Turn Golden Elixir Pills, each capable of granting eternal life. Wukong stuffed them all into his mouth and swallowed every last one.

Heaven Discovers the Chaos

Meanwhile, when the Queen Mother arrived at the Peach Garden, she found the place empty, peaches missing, and no Great Sage in sight. She summoned heavenly officers:

“Find Sun Wukong immediately!”

The Jade Emperor heard the full report:
Wukong had skipped duty, ruined the Peach Garden, crashed the banquet, drunk all the wine, and stolen Laozi’s elixir.

The Jade Emperor thundered with anger and ordered:

“Dispatch the Celestial Armies! Arrest the Monkey Immediately!”

The Four Heavenly Kings, along with Li Jing (the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King) and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, marched with tens of thousands of soldiers toward Flower-Fruit Mountain.

The Great Sage Prepares for Battle

Back on Flower-Fruit Mountain, Wukong returned full of elixir and wine. He gathered the monkeys and declared:

“I’m done with Heaven’s tricks! Anyone who comes to capture me—fight!”

He armed his monkey army, set up defenses, and waited.

Heaven’s First Attempt to Capture Wukong

The Celestial troops arrived. The heavenly generals expected an easy victory, but Wukong stood atop a cliff, wielding his gold-banded staff, laughing:

“If you want to capture me, come up here yourself!”

The gods attacked in waves:

The Four Horsemen of the Heavenly Gate were defeated.

The Twelve Thunder Generals were beaten back.

The Twenty-Eight Constellations used magic formations but were scattered.

Wukong used the Seventy-Two Transformations, creating hundreds of clones, overwhelming the soldiers.

No one could subdue him.

The Four Heavenly Kings finally reported back to the Jade Emperor:

“The Monkey is too powerful. We cannot capture him.”

A Divine Request

Hearing this, the Jade Emperor sought help from a higher power and ordered:

“Summon the Buddha-Emperor of the Tushita Heaven, the True Immortal Erlang Shen.”

And thus begins the next great battle — the confrontation between Sun Wukong and Erlang Shen, one of Heaven’s most formidable warriors.
