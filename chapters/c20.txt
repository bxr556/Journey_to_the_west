**Journey to the West – Chapter 20

The Yellow Robe Demon — Tang Sanzang’s Faith Tested**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

After escaping the spider demon, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse travel through a series of hills and valleys. Though the path appears calm, the land is full of cunning demons and spirits seeking to capture the monk for his flesh, believing it grants immortality and spiritual power.

Tang Sanzang focuses on meditation and prayer, while Sun Wukong flies ahead to scout for hidden dangers.

The Yellow Robe Demon Appears

In a quiet valley, a powerful yellow-robed demon lurks. This demon is known for his cunning and deceptive powers, capable of disguising himself as a holy man or wealthy traveler.

He devises a plan:

Appear as a venerable traveler.

Gain Tang Sanzang’s trust.

Capture the monk to consume his flesh and gain immortality.

When Tang Sanzang approaches the valley, the demon appears wearing flowing yellow robes, carrying a staff, and bowing respectfully.

“Honorable monk, I am on a spiritual pilgrimage like yourself. Please allow me to join you on your journey.”

Wukong Sees Through the Deception

Sun Wukong, with his Fiery Golden Eyes, immediately perceives the demon’s true form. He shouts:

“Master! Beware! This is the Yellow Robe Demon in disguise!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates, conflicted by his natural compassion and unwillingness to harm anyone who appears righteous.

The Battle with the Demon

The yellow-robed demon attacks, using powerful magic:

He conjures illusions to confuse the monk and the white dragon horse.

Rocks, wind, and fire are summoned to block the path.

He transforms repeatedly, attempting to evade Wukong’s strikes.

Sun Wukong uses his golden staff and Seventy-Two Transformations to counter each trick. He multiplies himself, attacks from multiple angles, and finally binds the demon in a magical chain.

After a fierce battle, Wukong subdues the demon, forcing him to retreat into the mountains.

Tang Sanzang Learns Faith and Discernment

After witnessing the battle, Tang Sanzang realizes:

“Disciple, I see now that my compassion must be tempered with wisdom. Some beings will exploit mercy, and I must trust your insight and skill.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, your faith and virtue are your strength, but my vigilance protects both you and your mission. Together, we will overcome all obstacles.”

The Pilgrimage Continues

With the yellow-robed demon defeated, the travelers continue westward:

Tang Sanzang develops patience, discernment, and faith in his disciples.

Sun Wukong demonstrates loyalty, courage, and cleverness.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe transport across rivers, valleys, and treacherous terrain.

The road ahead remains perilous, with more powerful and cunning demons awaiting the pilgrims. Each encounter strengthens their bond, preparing them for the ultimate journey to retrieve the sacred scriptures.
