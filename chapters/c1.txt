Journey to the West — Chapter 1

“The Birth of the Monkey King”
《第一回：灵根育孕源流出 心性修持大道生》

In the distant chaos before Heaven and Earth took form, the universe was a vast, swirling void. Over countless ages it divided into clear and turbid layers, becoming sky and earth. From the interplay of vital energies came the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and all living beings.

In the Eastern Sea lay an island called Aolai, upon which stood a mountain named the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. It was a place blessed with auspicious air and spiritual power: thick forests, fragrant grasses, singing birds, and sparkling streams. In the middle of the mountain rose a great immortal stone, nourished by the breath of heaven and earth. One day the stone suddenly split open with a clap, and from it leapt a stone egg. Meeting the wind, the egg transformed into a stone monkey, already capable of running and leaping.

As soon as the creatures of the mountain saw this newborn stone monkey, they accepted him among their group. He played with them daily, roaming among cliffs and forests. One day the troop discovered a great waterfall cascading down a cliff. They marveled at its beauty and wondered where its source lay. The monkeys agreed: whoever dared to leap through the waterfall to discover what was inside would become their king.

The stone monkey stepped forward without hesitation. With a shout, he jumped straight through the veil of water and found himself in a hidden cavern—an immortal dwelling, complete with stone tables, stone beds, and carvings marking it as the Water-Curtain Cave. He returned to tell the others, who cheered in amazement. Leading them inside, he was unanimously chosen as their king and took the title “Handsomeness Like Everlasting” (Beautiful Monkey King).

The Monkey King lived happily for many years, feasting, playing, and ruling his troop. Yet one day he sat in silence, troubled. His companions asked what was wrong. He replied, “Though we enjoy life now, one day death will claim us. I fear that fate.”

The monkeys praised his wise mind and urged him to seek a method to escape death. Thus the Monkey King resolved to leave the mountain and search the world for immortals who might teach him the Way.

He crossed seas and rivers, imitating human customs and learning human speech. After years of wandering, he came upon the Southern Continent, where people taught him to dress properly and behave as a traveler. Eventually, he found his way to a distant mountain where an immortal master taught the Way to selected disciples. The Monkey King presented himself before the master, bowing deeply.

Seeing the monkey’s intelligence and unusual aura, the master accepted him as a disciple and gave him the surname “Sun,” based on the character with the radical for “monkey.” Thus the stone monkey became Sun Wukong.

Sun Wukong was diligent and learned swiftly. His master taught him breathing techniques, spells, and the mysteries of transformation. Wukong practiced tirelessly and, over several years, mastered the Seventy-Two Transformations and the Cloud-Somersault, allowing him to leap tens of thousands of miles in a single bound.

His boldness and talent, however, also brought him trouble. One day, showing off his abilities, he drew the displeasure of the immortal master. But before sending him away, the master secretly taught Wukong several incantations of protection and warned him never to reveal the master’s name.

Thus Sun Wukong left his master’s mountain, returning to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with his newfound powers. His subjects celebrated wildly at the return of their king, who now possessed the arts of immortality—and the ambition for much, much more.
