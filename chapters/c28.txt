**Journey to the West – Chapter 28

The Gold and Silver Horned Demon — Wukong Faces a Formidable Foe**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue westward. The path leads them through rugged mountains and dense forests. The journey grows increasingly dangerous, as more powerful and cunning demons lie in wait, each hoping to capture Tang Sanzang for his flesh, which is believed to grant immortality and extraordinary powers.

Tang Sanzang remains devoted to prayer, while Sun Wukong scouts ahead, ready for any threats.

The Gold and Silver Horned Demon Appears

In a mountainous region, a powerful demon with gold and silver horns observes the pilgrims. Known for his immense strength and mastery of magical weapons, the demon devises a plan:

Lure Tang Sanzang into his lair with illusions of hospitality.

Capture the monk and consume his flesh to gain immortality and power.

Use his cunning and magical weapons to defeat any who oppose him.

The demon transforms into a kind, elderly man and approaches Tang Sanzang, pretending to offer guidance and assistance along the treacherous mountain path.

Wukong Sees Through the Deception

Sun Wukong immediately senses the demon’s true nature with his Fiery Golden Eyes. He warns Tang Sanzang:

“Master! This is the Gold and Silver Horned Demon in disguise! Do not trust him!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates, torn between his innate compassion and Wukong’s warning. He fears that refusing help would betray his moral principles.

The Battle Ensues

The demon, realizing his trick has been discovered, attacks with incredible force:

He wields magical weapons and summons the power of his gold and silver horns.

Rocks and boulders tumble down the mountain slopes.

Magical flames and illusions confuse the travelers.

Wukong engages the demon using his golden-banded staff and Seventy-Two Transformations, multiplying himself and attacking from multiple angles. Despite the demon’s formidable strength, Wukong eventually binds him with magical chains, forcing the demon to retreat deep into the mountains.

Tang Sanzang Learns Another Lesson

After the battle, Tang Sanzang reflects:

“Disciple, your skill and vigilance have once again protected us. I see now that compassion must be guided by wisdom, and I must trust your insight in times of danger.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, your virtue lights the path, but my strength ensures your safety. Together, we overcome any obstacle.”

The Pilgrimage Continues

With the Gold and Silver Horned Demon defeated, the travelers resume their journey:

Tang Sanzang grows wiser, learning the balance of mercy, discernment, and trust.

Sun Wukong demonstrates loyalty, courage, and cleverness.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe passage through the mountains and valleys.

Though the road to the West remains treacherous, each encounter strengthens the pilgrims’ bond and prepares them for the ultimate challenge: retrieving the sacred scriptures and returning them safely to the Tang Empire.
