**Journey to the West – Chapter 21

The Fiery Mountain — Wukong Battles the Flame Demon**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue their journey westward. The road leads them to a region of barren hills and scorching plains, where rivers of molten lava and flames engulf the landscape. The heat is oppressive, and even the white dragon horse struggles to navigate safely.

Tang Sanzang remains calm, reciting prayers to Guanyin Bodhisattva, while Wukong scouts ahead, alert for hidden dangers.

The Fiery Mountain Demon Appears

In the midst of this volcanic region dwells the Flame Demon, a powerful creature capable of controlling fire and heat. The demon has been terrorizing travelers and devouring those who venture too close.

Seeing Tang Sanzang and his companions, the Flame Demon sets the hills ablaze, intending to capture the monk and consume him for immortality and magical power.

“No one shall pass my domain alive!” the demon roars, flames curling around his massive form.

Wukong’s Battle

Sun Wukong leaps into action, wielding his golden-banded staff. He flies through flames, dodging molten rocks, and strikes the demon with precision.

The Flame Demon counters with:

Streams of fire that turn the air into a furnace

Lava eruptions to crush the monk and the horse

Shape-shifting illusions to confuse Wukong

Using his Seventy-Two Transformations and Fiery Golden Eyes, Wukong sees through every trick. He multiplies himself, attacking from multiple angles, and finally traps the demon with a magical chain and binds him under a mountain rock.

The fire subsides, and the terrain cools enough for safe passage.

Tang Sanzang’s Reflection

Tang Sanzang witnesses Wukong’s skill and courage. He realizes once again that virtue alone is not enough to survive the journey:

“Disciple, your strength and insight are invaluable. My prayers and compassion guide us, but your vigilance protects us from harm.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, your faith lights the path. My power ensures you reach the scriptures safely.”

The Pilgrimage Continues

With the Fiery Mountain demon defeated, the travelers rest briefly:

Tang Sanzang deepens his understanding of the balance between virtue, faith, and discernment.

Sun Wukong demonstrates unwavering loyalty, courage, and magical skill.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe passage through treacherous landscapes.

The journey west remains filled with demons, illusions, and moral tests. Each encounter strengthens the pilgrims’ bond and prepares them for the ultimate mission of bringing the sacred scriptures back to the Tang Empire.
