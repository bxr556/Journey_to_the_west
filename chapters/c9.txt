**Journey to the West – Chapter 9

Tang Sanzang’s Ordination and the Start of the Scripture Journey**

A Terror in the Underworld

The chapter begins with Emperor Taizong of Tang suffering a terrifying ordeal. After the episode in the River of the Dead (from earlier chapters), he is still shaken. That night, he dreams of ghosts pleading for justice over wrongful deaths.

Recognizing that the empire needs spiritual protection and redemption, Taizong decides to support the spread of Buddhism across the land.

Tang Sanzang Is Officially Ordained

In response, Taizong sends an imperial decree to the Hongfu Temple. The abbot chooses the virtuous monk Xuanzang, known for his purity, compassion, and unwavering discipline, to represent the Tang Empire.

Xuanzang is brought before the emperor, who praises his calm presence and noble spirit. Taizong personally oversees his ordination, giving him the Buddhist name:

“Tang Sanzang” —
Tang Dynasty Monk of the Three Treasuries (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).

Guanyin Makes Arrangements

Meanwhile, the Bodhisattva Guanyin returns secretly to check on the Tang emperor. She sees that Taizong’s heart is aligned with the divine mission, and she decides the time is right for the scripture quest to begin.

She appears in a dream to Taizong, revealing:

“In the West lies the Thunder Monastery of Buddha Tathagata. There are true scriptures there.
If you wish to save your people, send a monk to bring them back.”

The emperor believes the dream and wakes with renewed resolve.

The Imperial Audience

Taizong calls a grand court meeting. In front of ministers and generals, he announces that the empire must retrieve the Buddhist scriptures to enlighten the people.

Tang Sanzang volunteers to undertake the journey.

The emperor is deeply moved but warns him:

“The road is ten thousand miles long, full of demons and hardships.
Are you certain?”

Tang Sanzang replies with humility and determination:

“For the sake of all living beings, I fear no difficulty.”

Precious Gifts for the Journey

Taizong prepares an elaborate send-off:

A silk cassock embroidered with gold

A nine-ring monk’s staff

Travel documents granting safe passage through all provinces

Rich supplies, horses, and escorts

Although Tang Sanzang is a man of modesty, he accepts them out of respect for the emperor’s sincerity.

The Journey Begins

On an auspicious day, Tang Sanzang kneels before the imperial palace to express gratitude. Taizong personally escorts him to the city gate.

The emperor says with emotion:

“Return safely, Master. The fate of our people rests with you.”

Tang Sanzang bows deeply and sets off westward, accompanied by two imperial guards.

But the road is long and dangerous. By fate’s design, the guards will soon meet their end at the hands of a demon, leaving Tang Sanzang alone—so that he may meet his destined first disciple: Sun Wukong, still trapped under the Five Elements Mountain.

The stage is now set for their meeting.
