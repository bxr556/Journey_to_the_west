**Journey to the West – Chapter 24

The Scorpion Demon — Wukong’s Skill and Tang Sanzang’s Compassion Tested**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

After defeating the yellow-winged demon, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue westward. The path now leads them through dense forests and rocky valleys, where danger lurks in hidden corners. Despite the calm appearance of the land, demons and spirits are constantly seeking to capture the monk, believing that his flesh grants immortality and spiritual power.

Tang Sanzang focuses on prayer, while Sun Wukong scouts ahead, alert for any signs of danger.

The Scorpion Demon Appears

In a dark, narrow valley, a scorpion demoness observes the travelers. She is known for her deadly venom and her ability to create illusions.

The demoness devises a plan:

Transform into a helpless maiden.

Approach Tang Sanzang, feigning innocence and need.

Trap the monk to consume his flesh for power and immortality.

When Tang Sanzang enters the valley, the demoness appears as a beautiful woman, bowing respectfully:

“Honorable monk, please help me. I am lost and weak. I beg for your guidance.”

Wukong Sees Through the Illusion

Sun Wukong, with his Fiery Golden Eyes, immediately perceives the demoness’s true form. He flies down and warns:

“Master! Do not be deceived! This is a scorpion demoness with deadly intent!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates, torn between his natural compassion and Wukong’s warning.

The Battle in the Valley

The scorpion demoness attacks with deadly venom and illusions:

She creates giant scorpions to surround the travelers.

Magical mist and darkness confuse the path.

Her tail strikes with poisonous venom.

Wukong leaps into action with his golden-banded staff. Using his Seventy-Two Transformations, he multiplies himself, confuses the scorpions, and strikes the demoness repeatedly.

Despite her clever illusions, Wukong’s skill and vigilance prevail. He traps the scorpion demoness in a magical binding spell, forcing her to retreat into the mountains. The valley becomes calm once more.

Tang Sanzang’s Reflection

After the battle, Tang Sanzang reflects:

“Disciple, I see now that while compassion is my path, discernment and trust in your skill are essential for our safety. Mercy alone cannot overcome deception and danger.”

Wukong replies:

“Master, your virtue lights the way, but my vigilance protects it. Together, we ensure the success of our pilgrimage.”

The Pilgrimage Continues

Having survived the scorpion demoness, the travelers press onward:

Tang Sanzang grows wiser, learning to trust his disciples while maintaining compassion.

Sun Wukong demonstrates loyalty, courage, and cleverness once again.

The White Dragon Horse continues to provide safe transport through treacherous terrain.

The road to the West remains fraught with danger, as ever more powerful and cunning demons await. Each encounter strengthens the bond between the pilgrims and prepares them for the ultimate challenge: retrieving the sacred scriptures and returning them to the Tang Empire.
