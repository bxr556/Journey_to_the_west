**Journey to the West – Chapter 17

The Leopard Demon’s Trap — Tang Sanzang’s Patience Tested**

Continuing the Pilgrimage

After safely crossing the river, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and the white dragon horse continue their westward journey. The landscape changes from forests to rocky hills, and the air grows colder and more ominous. The monk remains devoted to prayer, while Sun Wukong scouts ahead for hidden threats.

The pilgrimage is filled with dangers—demons and spirits who crave the monk’s flesh for its spiritual energy are ever watchful.

The Leopard Demon Appears

In a narrow mountain pass, a cunning leopard demon lies in wait. This demon is skilled in illusions and deception.

He watches the travelers carefully, then transforms into a helpless old man, leaning on a cane.

“Good travelers,” he calls softly, “please help me. I am weak and cannot move. My family is in danger.”

Tang Sanzang, with his compassionate heart, immediately approaches:

“Disciple, we must help this poor man. Such suffering must not go unattended.”

Sun Wukong, seeing through the disguise, shouts:

“Master, do not be fooled! This is no ordinary man—he is a leopard demon in disguise!”

Tang Sanzang hesitates. He does not want to believe Wukong, thinking that all beings deserve mercy.

Wukong’s Frustration and the Battle

The leopard demon, realizing Tang Sanzang might resist, attacks suddenly:

Rocks and boulders are hurled down the mountain pass.

The demon summons illusions of wolves and snakes to surround the monk.

Wukong jumps into action. Using his golden staff and Seventy-Two Transformations, he counters the illusions and strikes the demon.

The leopard demon escapes multiple times using shapeshifting, taking forms of other animals and even mountain spirits.

Finally, Wukong traps him using a magical rope and strikes him with his staff, forcing the demon to retreat into the depths of the mountain.

Tang Sanzang Learns a Hard Lesson

After the demon flees, Tang Sanzang scolds Wukong again for violence. But he also realizes:

“Disciple, while I must practice compassion, I cannot ignore the reality of evil. Some beings intend harm. I must learn to trust your judgment.”

Wukong nods, knowing that the monk is learning patience and discernment—key lessons for the long pilgrimage ahead.

The Journey Continues

The group rests briefly, offering prayers for the spirit of the demon and asking Guanyin Bodhisattva for continued guidance.

They continue westward:

Tang Sanzang develops the wisdom to balance mercy with discernment.

Sun Wukong proves his loyalty, strength, and cleverness.

The White Dragon Horse remains a steadfast means of safe passage.

The path to the West grows more treacherous, and more cunning and powerful demons await, testing the physical and moral strength of the pilgrims.
